I wrote a post yesterday about [triple-column navigation](https://kean.blog/post/triple-trouble) in SwiftUI. It felt a bit awkward posting it because this really shouldn't be some obscure knowledge. This is hardly a challenging problem. But to me and to many other people, this *was* challenging.

Why was it challenging? The `NavigationView` [documentation page](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationview) doesn't mention a triple-column layout or macOS at all for that matter. But the simple lack of content is not the only problem with Apple Documentation.

## Navigation

Ironically, navigation is one the major issues. When you just open the [root SwiftUI documentation page](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui), you see is a small list of topics. In fact, what you see on the screenshot is the entire contents of the home page. There is no index where you can see all children pages. You need to drill down multiple pages to find what you are looking for.

<img class="NewScreenshot" src="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/apple-docs/01.png">

The first item on the list is not part of this documentation, it's a link that opens the root page containing all [SwiftUI Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/SwiftUI).

The categories are rather arbitrary. They can't be specific given how few there are. There is no way of knowing whether what you looking for is going to be in the category without opening the page first. For example, can you guess where `List`, `Divider`, `Alert`, and `EmptyView` are? It is in "View Layout and Presentation", not in "Views and Controls".

When you drill down the navigation hierarchy the only sense of where you are in the documentation hierarchy is the tiny navigation strip at the top.

Now, to go to a different page, you need to either navigate back or hope that the links in a "See Also" section at the very bottom of the page are going to be relevant to you.

If you want to compare it with how it could and should have been done instead, here is a screenshot from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-nested-graphs)

There are many things that Google does right on this page. First, unlike Apple documentation which appears as it was designed for mobile, Google takes full advantage of a bigger screen *and* it also works great on mobile. Second, you get a full overview and control of the navigation:

- A complete and priotirized index of pages to the left with sensible categories
- You can navigate different *types* of documentation using tabs at the top
- There is a table of contents on the right, Apple doesn't have that

Up to this point I've been comparing apples to oranges. The Google documentation page is what a developer looking to build something for Android sees. It covers all topics, including basics, architecture, navigation, persistence, deployment, etc. I was compating it with the SwiftUI page. What does the home page look like?

Where should someone who is just looking to build an iOS start from? The "Featured" tab looks like a landing page for a cool new product. It's slick, minimal, but hardly useful. And the "Technologies" tab is just an alphabetically sorted list of everything there is.

## Types of Documentation

There are generally three types of documentation:

- **Tutorials**, learning-oriented, focused on practical steps
- **Guides**, problem and understanding-oriented, focus on both practical and theoretical knowledge
- **Reference**, information-oriented, typically just a complete list of all available APIs

### Tutorials

Tutorials are generally the easier types of documentation to write. You take a specific problem and describe the steps to solve it. They don't need to provide deep knowledge, they don't need to be complete, and they can overlook certain aspects of the technology. For example, [Triple Trouble](https://kean.blog/post/triple-trouble) took me 20 minutes to write, [SwiftUI Layout System](https://kean.blog/post/swiftui-layout-system) - more than a week.

Back in the Objective-C days, Apple's focus was on providing guides offering a [deep understanding](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewPG_iPhoneOS/Introduction/Introduction.html) of the topic. With SwiftUI, the focused switched to [tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/). These are nicely produced, but that just raises concerns about prioritization issues. As a result, Apple now writes tutorials, and the community writes [The Complete Guide to NavigationView in SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/216/complete-guide-to-navigationview-in-swiftui). The situation is completely backward.

### Guides

Apple still writes guides in some form. But there is a problem â€“ they are hard to find. You typically want to separate different types of documentation because they all serve different purposes. Google does this, but Apple does the opposite. They mix all types of documentation in a bland mass of gray with an unconscionable amount of spacing.

For example, on the screenshot below you can find a tutorial, two guides, and multiple references. This page could benefit from color differentiation.

### API Reference

The goal of a reference is to provide a complete list of the available APIs with some basic description of how these APIs work. A reference can be auto-generated from code, assuming you have inline documentation. For example, [Nuke reference](https://kean-org.github.io/docs/nuke/reference/9.2.0/) is generated using [swift-doc](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc) by [mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt).

You often don't even need a reference as a document. To learn about APIs, you can use inline documentation in Xcode. And for a deep understanding of topics, you use guides. This is why it's generally a good idea to separate a reference from a guide. In Apple documentation, things are more complicated.

Let's take [`NavigationView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationview) page as an example. This page is classified as a reference which is indicated by the fact the there is no icon and it says "struct".

<img class="NewScreenshot" src="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/apple-docs/10.png">

But when you open the page, there is a mini-guide there.

<img class="NewScreenshot" src="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/apple-docs/08.png">

And the reference? Empty.

<img class="NewScreenshot" src="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/apple-docs/09.png">

This page doesn't serve as a reference. For example, there is no way of knowing from this page that you can apply a [`navigationViewStyle(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationview/navigationviewstyle(_:)) modifier to `NavigationView`. Apple themselves made it hard to generate a good reference for SwiftUI because of the way APIs are designed using generics. This problem appears not just in the documentation, but also in code completion, and in other systems that were not updated to accommodate the SwiftUI API design.

This page also doesn't serve as a good guide. `NavigationView` is one of the most complex components in SwiftUI, it requires much more than a page of text to describe. 

API references in Apple documentation often have these hidden mini-guides in them. But you never know which page is going to have this mini-guide and which isn't. As a result, when you can't find enough information you have to fish for these mini-guides scattered all over the API references to find at least some information.

### Video

We all know this one. WWDC videos are no longer complementary to the documentation. They contain crucial information that can often only be found in these videos. For example, the only place where you can learn that [XCFrameworks](https://kean.blog/post/xcframeworks-caveats) can't have Swift package dependencies is the very end (`38:16`) of a WWDC [video from 2019](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/416/). Videos are not searchable. Even if you saw the video during WWDC, there is no quick way to remind yourself of what it was about.

## Conclusion

Apple documentation used to be one of the best in the industry. It's painful to watch how far it's fallen. And the problems don't end with the pure lack of content which I haven't even mentioned in the article.
