{:.warning}

Consuming a web service API was a major part of almost all the projects that I worked on. Each one of them had a different approach to networking.

- My very first iOS project was built using [ASIHTTPRequest](https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request). `AFNetworking` was yet to be released. The XML responses were parsed using [TouchXML](https://github.com/TouchCode/TouchXML).
- The next major project I've worked on used [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) â€“ a new modern framework at the time. Later, we wrapped the API calls using our in-house [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com) to make things like chaining requests easier. This was well before [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit) first appeared on GitHub. The JSON responses were parsed manually with a help of a simple [safe_cast](https://gist.github.com/kean/3600ad35c818a6b28caa3e0fa026d478) macro.
- At my previous project, we had a custom API layer written on top of `NSURLSession` (no `AFNetworking`). It had some advanced stuff in it such as [batch HTTP requests](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-snell-http-batch-00.html#http-batch). We used a simple in-house JSON framework similar in terms of features to one of the first Swift JSON wrappers [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON).

{% include ad-hor.html %}

Each of these approaches had its strengths and weaknesses. And in this article, I'd like to share my latest networking stack. It has a small yet powerful API, type-safe authorization scopes, endpoints modeled in a declarative and concise way, and support for OAuth 2 "refresh access token" flow. It takes full advantage of the open-source frameworks to achieve all of these powerful features.

## Dependencies

Let's start with dependencies. As the Swift ecosystem grows, it becomes increasingly more complicated to select the right tools for the job. Especially for someone who likes to go through an entire library code base before making a final choice.

### 1. Alamofire

[Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) is a workhorse of many iOS projects. It has a lot of convenient features:

- Dispatches from `Foundation.URLSession(Task/DataTask)Delegate` methods to individual requests
- Parameter encoding, including URL encoding and JSON encoding
- Response validation
- Default `Accept-Encoding`, `Accept-Language`, and `User-Agent` HTTP headers
- Tools for implementing automatic OAuth 2 "refresh access token" dance
- Generate cURL command output
- Automatically show and hide network activity indicator

`Alamofire` is a great framework with a solid code base and comprehensive documentation. The only real alternative to `Alamofire` is writing an abstraction on top of `Foundation.URLSession`. It's possible and is even relatively simple, but it requires a lot of boilerplate code.

### 2. RxSwift

[RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) has become a must-have tool for me. It gives you all of the advantages of promises and [more](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/Documentation/Why.md). One of its underrated features, which happens to be one of me my favorite, is its built-in [testing support](https://kean.github.io/post/rxswift-testing). I will provide a couple of examples later in the "Usage" section demonstrating why you want your network calls to be observables.

> Another popular reactive programming framework is [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift). It's also a solid choice, and many people prefer it over RxSwift.
{:.info}

### 3. Codable

The new [Swift Encoders and Decoders](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0167-swift-encoders.md) - `Codable` - is the way to go for the majority of the apps. `Codable` was introduced in Swift 4 with a [motivation](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0167-swift-encoders.md#motivation) to replace old `NSCoding` APIs. Unlike `NSCoding` it has first-class JSON support which makes it a promising option for consuming JSON APIs. `Codable` does have a few drawbacks which you can learn more about in a separate post [**Codable: Tips and Tricks**](https://kean.github.io/post/codable-tips-and-tricks).

There are a lot of third-party alternatives which were in use before Swift 4. Some of them still have advantages over `Codable`. There is a [great article](https://github.com/bwhiteley/JSONShootout) that gives an overview of all of the major third-party JSON libraries.

## Endpoint

Now let's dive into the code. First, we need a way to model network requests.

My priorities are that the endpoints should be modeled in a type-safe, declarative, and concise way. It should be easy to add, use, and modify them. In its simplest form `Endpoint` is described using `HTTP method`, `path`, `parameters`, and a way to decode the response:

```swift
final class Endpoint<Response> {
    let method: Method
    let path: Path
    let parameters: Parameters?
    let decode: (Data) throws -> Response
}

typealias Parameters = [String: Any]
typealias Path = String

enum Method {
    case get, post, put, patch, delete
}
```

To make endpoint initializers more concise, the `decode` closure can be inferred automatically.

```swift
extension Endpoint where Response: Swift.Decodable {
    convenience init(method: Method = .get,
                     path: Path,
                     parameters: Parameters? = nil) {
        self.init(method: method, path: path, parameters: parameters) {
            try JSONDecoder().decode(Response.self, from: $0)
        }
    }
}

extension Endpoint where Response == Void {
    convenience init(method: Method = .get,
                     path: Path,
                     parameters: Parameters? = nil) {
        self.init(
            method: method,
            path: path,
            parameters: parameters,
            decode: { _ in () }
        )
    }
}
```

Let's define a couple of endpoints to see how it works in practice:

```swift
extension API {
    static func getCustomer() -> Endpoint<Customer> {
        Endpoint(path: "customer/profile")
    }

    static func patchCustomer(firstName: String, lastName: String) -> Endpoint<Customer> {
        Endpoint(
            method: .patch,
            path: "customer/profile",
            parameters: ["firstName" : firstName,
                         "lastName" : lastName]
        )
    }
}
```

This is not the only way to organize endpoints. My personal preference is to put endpoints in a hierarchy of namespaces (the closest thing to "emulate" namespaces in Swift are enums with no cases):

```swift
extension API {
    /* namespace */ enum Customer {
        private static let path = "customer/profile"

        static func get() -> Endpoint<App.Customer> {
            Endpoint(path: path)
        }

        static func patch(firstName: String, lastName: String) -> Endpoint<App.Customer> {
            return Endpoint(
                method: .patch,
                path: path,
                parameters: ["firstName" : firstName,
                             "lastName" : lastName]
            )
        }
    }
}
```

This approach closely resembles the way REST models resources, but it has it's downsides too - it's less auto-complete friendly, and it introduces a bunch of new types into the system.

> I've seen [suggestions](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/blob/master/docs/Examples/Basic.md) to model APIs as an enum where each property has a separate switch. This isn't ideal because you are setting yourself for merge conflicts, and it harder to read and modify than other approaches. When you add a new call, you should ideally only need to make a change in one place.
{:.warning}

## Client

The next question is how to perform the requests. Let's create a `APIClient` type to do just that. 

```swift
final class APIClient: APIClientProtocol {
    private let manager: Alamofire.SessionManager
    private let baseURL = URL(string: "<your_server_base_url>")!
    private let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "<your_queue_label>")

    init(accessToken: String) {
        var defaultHeaders = Alamofire.SessionManager.defaultHTTPHeaders
        defaultHeaders["Authorization"] = "Bearer \(accessToken)"

        let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default

        // Add `Auth` header to the default HTTP headers set by `Alamofire`
        configuration.httpAdditionalHeaders = defaultHeaders

        self.manager = Alamofire.SessionManager(configuration: configuration)
        self.manager.retrier = OAuth2Retrier()
    }
}
```

The client takes endpoint parameters, fills the rest of the defaults including the access token, base URL, etc, and carries out the request using an underlying `Alamofire.SessionManager`:

```swift
func request<Response>(_ endpoint: Endpoint<Response>) -> Single<Response> {
    Single<Response>.create { observer in
        let request = self.manager.request(
            baseURL.appendingPathComponent(endpoint.path),
            method: httpMethod(from: endpoint.method),
            parameters: endpoint.parameters
        )
        request.validate().responseData(queue: self.queue) { response in
            let result = response.result.flatMap(endpoint.decode)
            switch result {
            case let .success(val): observer(.success(val))
            case let .failure(err): observer(.error(err))
            }
        }
        return Disposables.create {
            request.cancel()
        }
    }
}
```

The requests are wrapped in a `Single` observable provided by `RxSwift`.

> A `Single` is a variation of `Observable` that, instead of emitting a series of elements, is always guaranteed to emit either a single element or an error. The common use case of `Single` is to wrap HTTP requests. See [Traits](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/Documentation/Traits.md#single) for more info.
{:.info}

The `OAuth2Retrier` type is responsible for refreshing access tokens:

```swift
private class OAuth2Retrier: Alamofire.RequestRetrier {
    func should(_ manager: SessionManager, retry request: Request, with error: Error, completion: @escaping RequestRetryCompletion) {
        if (error as? AFError)?.responseCode == 401 {
            // TODO: implement your Auth2 refresh flow
            // See https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire#adapting-and-retrying-requests 
        }
        completion(false, 0)
    }
}
```


## Usage

We now have everything in place to start using API endpoints. Let's create a client and start a request.

```swift
let client = Client(accessToken: "<access_token>")
_ = client.request(API.Customer.get())
_ = client.request(API.Customer.patch(firstName: "First", lastName: "Last"))
```

> It's a good practice to perform network calls only from the Model layer. I like to create "services" that represent the main app's features. For example, for a `API.Customer` would only be used directly inside `CustomerService` class.
{:.info}

The requests return [cold observables](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/Documentation/HotAndColdObservables.md). So nothing is going to happen until someone subscribes to the observable. I'm not going to dive into details about RxSwift and how to use it, but I will show a couple of examples of why observables are so useful.

**Load two resources simultaneously and continue only when both requests were successful**

Suppose you need to load two entities from the backed simultaneously. Without Rx, it's a challenge to manually manage the state of both requests. But with [`combineLatest`](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/combinelatest.html) operator, it takes a single line of code:

```swift
let dependencies = Observable.combineLatest(
    client.request(API.Categories.get()),
    client.request(API.Customer.get())
)
```

**Chain two requests**

Suppose you may want to upload an image to the resource service and then patch a customer entry with an `imageId` returned by the first request. Here's how you can do it with Rx:

```swift
_ = resourseService.upload(image).flatMap { imageId in
    customerService.patch(avatarId: imageId)
}
```

**Implement autocomplete field**

A classic example of Rx that you will find in almost any reactive library:

```swift
let isBusy = ActivityIndicator()
self.suggestions = input
    .throttle(0.3)
    .distinctUntilChanged()
    .flatMapLatest { input in
        guard input.characters.count > 1 else { return .just([]) }
        return locationService.autocomplete(input)
            .trackActivity(isBusy)
            .asDriver(onErrorJustReturn: [])
}
```

There are a bunch of other benefits of using Rx. For example:

- Tracking activity of multiple network requests executing at the same time can be done automatically with [ActivityIndicator](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxSwiftUtilities) class
- Dispose bags allow you to easily tie the lifetime of your network operations to lifetime of other objects (e.g. view controllers)


## Type-Safe Authorization Scopes

Another interesting problem is how to model authorization scopes using Swift. The web service API which I'm currently working with has two levels of authorizations: 

- `Guest` - the lowest level of authorization, has access only to a handful of methods
- `Customer` - superset of `Guest` in terms of permissions

> This is an **experimental** feature. I'm still testing this approach and haven't yet put this in production code.
{:.warning}

I'd like to represent those concepts using Swift type system. I want to be able to "say" that "this API client is initialized with a guest token", and "that API endpoint can only be performed by customer", and the compiler should prevent me from performing endpoints with customer scope using a client initialized with a guest token.

The simplest way to implement this is to create a specific type to represent each of those concepts (e.g. `GuestEndpoint`, `CustomerClient`). However, we can do something different. Another way to achieve this is by leveraging Swift generics system. What I would do is create two separate [phantom types](https://rustbyexample.com/generics/phantom.html) that represent each of authorization scopes (`Scope.Guest` and `Scope.Customer`).

> A phantom type parameter is one that doesn't show up at runtime, but is checked statically (and only) at compile time. Types can use extra generic type parameters to act as markers or to perform type checking at compile time. These extra parameters hold no storage values, and have no runtime behavior.
{:.info}

I wrap API client and every endpoint in generic wrappers (`AuthorizedClient<Authorization>` and `AuthorizedEndpoint<Authorization, Response>` respectively) that I then parameterize with concrete scopes:

```swift
struct Scope {
    enum Guest {}
    enum Customer {}
}

struct AuthorizedEndpoint<Authorization, Response> {
    fileprivate let raw: Endpoint<Response>
    init(raw: Endpoint<Response>) { self.raw = raw }
}

struct AuthorizedClient<Authorization> {
    fileprivate let raw: ClientProtocol
    init(raw: ClientProtocol) { self.raw = raw }
}
```

Let's take advantage of [extensions with generic where clauses](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Generics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH26-ID553) to represent permissions in `AuthorizedClient`:

```swift
// API client with a `Guest` authorization can only perform requests
// with a lowest (`Guest`) authorization scope.
extension AuthorizedClient where Authorization == Scope.Guest {
    func request<Response>(_ endpoint: AuthorizedEndpoint<Scope.Guest, Response>) -> Single<Response> {
        return raw.request(endpoint.raw)
    }
}

// API client with a `Customer` authorization can perform requests
// with both `Guest` and `Customer` authorization scopes.
extension AuthorizedClient where Authorization == Scope.Customer {
    func request<Response>(_ endpoint: AuthorizedEndpoint<Scope.Guest, Response>) -> Single<Response> {
        return raw.request(endpoint.raw)
    }

    func request<Response>(_ endpoint: AuthorizedEndpoint<Scope.Customer, Response>) -> Single<Response> {
        return raw.request(endpoint.raw)
    }
}
```

Let's use new `AuthorizedEndpoint` type to represent a couple of endpoints:

```swift
extension API {
    static func postFeedback(email: String, message: String) -> AuthorizedEndpoint<Scope.Guest, Void> {
        return AuthorizedEndpoint(
            raw: Endpoint(
                method: .post,
                path: "/feedback",
                parameters: ["email": email,
                             "message": message]
            )
        )
    }

    static func getCustomer() -> AuthorizedEndpoint<Scope.Customer, Customer> {
        return AuthorizedEndpoint(
            raw: Endpoint(path: "/customer/profile")
        )
    }
}
```

Now let's put those new types into test:

```swift
let accessToken = "customer_auth_token"
let client = AuthorizedClient<Scope.Guest>(raw: Client(accessToken: accessToken))

// This line gets compiled successfully.
_ = client.request(API.postFeedback(email: "email", message: "message"))

// And this doesn't.
_ = client.request(API.getCustomerProfile())
```

Great, this works just as expected! The Swift type system is so much more powerful than Objective-C, it's fantastic what you can do with it.

## Conclusion

I hope you've enjoyed this! Please keep in mind that all of those decisions were made in the context of the app and the web service for which it was implemented. I would advise against adopting any of the described decisions without careful consideration.

It's hard to imagine now that there was a time when the only relatively easy-to-use tool for iOS developers to do networking was `ASIHTTPRequest`. It's just amazing that we now have so many great tools at our disposal. It's now up to us to make the best use of them.
